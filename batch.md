This code defines a my_batch_process function that performs some batch processing (you can replace this with your own batch processing function). The sched module is used to schedule this function to run at the same time every day. The while True loop ensures that the batch process runs indefinitely, scheduling itself to run again at the next daily interval.

In this example code, the batch process is scheduled to run every day at midnight (i.e., the start of the day). You can modify the start_time variable to set the desired start time. For example, if you want the batch process to run every day at 6:00 AM, you can set start_time as follows:

```python
start_time = datetime.now().replace(hour=6, minute=0, second=0, microsecond=0)
```

Note that this code will keep running indefinitely, so you will need to manually stop it when you want to stop the batch process. You can do this by pressing Ctrl+C in the terminal. Alternatively, you can modify the code to set a maximum number of runs, or to stop after a certain time interval has elapsed.
